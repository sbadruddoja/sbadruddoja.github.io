## Summary
I work on securing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms through blockchain networks to address model poisoning attacks. Machine learning algorithms are prone to data manipulation that breaks the integrity of predictions. Moreover, a central system has a single point of failure and is easily compromised. Blockchain provides provenance, integrity, decentralized, consensus-based, and fault-tolerant architecture to create trusted transactions. However, smart contracts in blockchain fail to calculate fixed-point computations limiting the plausibility of predictions through cognitive algorithms in the blockchain. I investigate the limitations of smart contracts that restrict learning capabilities in the blockchain. Moreover, I have developed a mathematical model to predict classes using machine learning algorithms. The numerical methods developed in my work arm smart contracts to estimate the likelihood of events or classes using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, I analyzed the performance of the blockchain network to provide cognitive intelligence. I would like to extend my work further to secure AI algorithms. Moreover, my prime research interests are in computer security, distributed systems, computer networks, network security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, blockchain, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms. I am also open to any research related to cybersecurity and AI to produce a state-of-the-art solution.

### Core Objectives of Future Research

* Developing Scalable Consensus Protocol for AI:  To optimize the proof of stake consensus protocol by introducing faster validation methods using a lower range of block proposals, cheaper transactions, and decentralized participation of miners/validators to maintain the honesty of the systems.

* Decentralized Cross-chain Communication: To improve cross-chain communication by optimizing atomic swaps, chain relays, and hash timeclock contracts to provide trusted and secured transactions removing the third party. Additionally, design decentralized collateralization in a bi-party transaction to punish fraudulent transactions.

* Consensus for Deliberative Agreement and Group Decisions:  To develop deliberative agreement through natural language processing, dialogue response generation, machine learning, and consensus management. Investigate the requirements to support review and justice systems where group decisions are inevitable.

* Data Cooperative Security:  To develop a distributed secure architecture to protect data that shared by providers using k-anonymity, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption for the confidentiality of data cooperatives with blockchain systems.

* IoT Network Security: Smart contracts can enhance the integrity of DDoS detections. However, blockchain consensus protocols require modification to achieve a consensus among IoT devices to detect, mitigate and recover from DDoS attacks in IoT. I plan to develop a decentralized machine learning-based consensus mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in IoT Systems.

* Smart Legal Contracts for Metaverse: The smart legal contracts helps to remove ambiguity in a service-level agreement. However, it still requires a rigorous stress test to measure the complexity and performance by converting a large number of paper contracts. I plan to stress test the performance of conversions by recording time, cost, complexity, ambiguity level and advantage index.

<--## Research Development
I am currently helping students at [Network Security Lab](https://nsl.cse.unt.edu/home) in research and investigations.  I am guiding students to pursue sound theoretical and practical research in data privacy, consensus protocols and metaverse interoprability. I plan apply for grants to finance future projects for funding students to produce impactful research. I plan to apply for grants and proposals to government and non-government institutes such as National Science Foundation (NSF), DARPA, Microsoft, and IBM. I will work specifically on the [Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI)](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cybersecurity-innovation-cyberinfrastructure-cici), [Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/secure-trustworthy-cyberspace-satc), and [Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Frontiers (SaTC Frontiers)](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/secure-trustworthy-cyberspace-frontiers-satc#:~:text=The%20Secure%20and%20Trustworthy%20Cyberspace,and%20social%20and%20behavioral%20sciences) programs.--!>
