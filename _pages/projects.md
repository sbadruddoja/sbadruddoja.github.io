## Aravind Yuvaraj - Blockchain for Ride-Sharing Services
Ride-sharing contracts on the blockchain rely on smart contracts to complete transactions. It is vital to maintain the dependability and security of these contracts, as errors could result in exploitation and loss. The ride-sharing sector is dealing with difficulties such as driver exploitation, price changes, and worries about sustainability. Understanding these issues is critical because they have a direct impact on the economics, safety, and ethical implications of our daily transportation choices. By utilizing smart contracts to assure equitable compensation, enhancing trust between drivers and riders, and enabling safe, tamper-proof record-keeping, the decentralized ledger's transparency may collectively foster an ecosystem that is more accountable and efficient.
  
## Varun Bailapudi - Sharding can Scale Blockchain-based Alert Management Systems
Alerts play a vital role in conveying information about events, promptly responding to them can prevent disastrous consequences. Many alerting apps face issues with centralized servers, leading to vulnerabilities. Users also encounter problems like anonymous profiles and falsified alerts that undermine trust. Hence, Transforming Alert Management Systems is imperative due to their challenges. In pursuing improved technologies, the adoption of Blockchain emerged as a solution to address these issues. Blockchainâ€™s characteristics, including enhanced security, unmodifiable data records, and eliminating central authority, make it ideal for creating a Decentralized Alerting Application(Dapp). Moreover, delays in emergency services reaching the location can pose serious issues that can be effectively addressed by leveraging community first responders living close to the incident site. The primary focus of this study is leveraging these features to create a Dapp that provides tamperproof alerts, combating fake alerts. While businesses migrating to Blockchain are concerned about transaction time impacting user migration, Sharding, a cost-effective Layer 1 Blockchain Scalability solution, is proposed as an efficient solution. This research explores how Sharding can enhance Blockchain-based Alert systems by reducing costs and time and improving security.

## Bashar Allwza - Defending Model Poisoning Attack Using Morphological Filters
As it is challenging to collect data and could be expensive with time and resources, AI developers must look for online pre-collected datasets to train the model. Online resources enable developers to develop the AI model instantly without spending time collecting the data themselves. However, Online data resources have brought new cybersecurity threats as the attacker can embed poisoned data in the dataset that is undetectable by the developers. This data poison allows the attacker to take control of the model or cause it to have wrong outputs. This project aims to defend and preventing data poisoning attacks on AI, pre-checking and removing the poisoned data, or reducing its effect on AI model prediction

## Rohit Tripathi - DeepFake Detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of AI-generated deepfakes poses a significant threat to content authenticity. This project aims to develop an innovative deepfake detection system that leverages the power of explainable AI (XAI) techniques. By combining interpretable machine learning models with stateof-the-art neural networks, the proposed solution will analyze audio, video, and imagery to accurately identify AI-manipulated fabrications. Explainable AI methods, such as feature attribution and saliency maps, will provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness. The system will be accessible through a web or browser interface, empowering online users to verify content authenticity and mitigate the spread of disinformation.
