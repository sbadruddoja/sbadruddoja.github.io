## Aravind Yuvaraj - Blockchain for Ride-Sharing Services
<p style="font-size:14px;"> Ride-sharing contracts on the blockchain rely on smart contracts to complete transactions. It is vital to maintain the dependability and security of these contracts, as errors could result in exploitation and loss. The ride-sharing sector is dealing with difficulties such as driver exploitation, price changes, and worries about sustainability. Understanding these issues is critical because they have a direct impact on the economics, safety, and ethical implications of our daily transportation choices. By utilizing smart contracts to assure equitable compensation, enhancing trust between drivers and riders, and enabling safe, tamper-proof record-keeping, the decentralized ledger's transparency may collectively foster an ecosystem that is more accountable and efficient.</p>
  
## Varun Bailapudi - Sharding can Scale Blockchain-based Alert Management Systems
<p style="font-size:14px;">Alerts play a vital role in conveying information about events, promptly responding to them can prevent disastrous consequences. Many alerting apps face issues with centralized servers, leading to vulnerabilities. Users also encounter problems like anonymous profiles and falsified alerts that undermine trust. Hence, Transforming Alert Management Systems is imperative due to their challenges. In pursuing improved technologies, the adoption of Blockchain emerged as a solution to address these issues. Blockchain’s characteristics, including enhanced security, unmodifiable data records, and eliminating central authority, make it ideal for creating a Decentralized Alerting Application(Dapp). Moreover, delays in emergency services reaching the location can pose serious issues that can be effectively addressed by leveraging community first responders living close to the incident site. The primary focus of this study is leveraging these features to create a Dapp that provides tamperproof alerts, combating fake alerts. While businesses migrating to Blockchain are concerned about transaction time impacting user migration, Sharding, a cost-effective Layer 1 Blockchain Scalability solution, is proposed as an efficient solution. This research explores how Sharding can enhance Blockchain-based Alert systems by reducing costs and time and improving security.</p>

## Bashar Allwza - Defending Model Poisoning Attack Using Morphological Filters
<p style="font-size:14px;">As it is challenging to collect data and could be expensive with time and resources, AI developers must look for online pre-collected datasets to train the model. Online resources enable developers to develop the AI model instantly without spending time collecting the data themselves. However, Online data resources have brought new cybersecurity threats as the attacker can embed poisoned data in the dataset that is undetectable by the developers. This data poison allows the attacker to take control of the model or cause it to have wrong outputs. This project aims to defend and preventing data poisoning attacks on AI, pre-checking and removing the poisoned data, or reducing its effect on AI model prediction.</p>

## Rohit Tripathi - DeepFake Detection with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
<p style="font-size:14px;">In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of AI-generated deepfakes poses a significant threat to content authenticity. This project aims to develop an innovative deepfake detection system that leverages the power of explainable AI (XAI) techniques. By combining interpretable machine learning models with stateof-the-art neural networks, the proposed solution will analyze audio, video, and imagery to accurately identify AI-manipulated fabrications. Explainable AI methods, such as feature attribution and saliency maps, will provide insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness. The system will be accessible through a web or browser interface, empowering online users to verify content authenticity and mitigate the spread of disinformation.</p>

## Sasi Kanduri - Randomizing Forger Selection to Improve Decentralization in Proof of Stake Consensus Protocol
<p style="font-size:14px;">
In proof-of-stake consensus protocols, the inherent design often favors wealthier participants, perpetuating a cycle where the rich become richer, thereby consolidating control over validation and block creation. This dynamic discourages broader participation, as smaller or less resource-rich nodes are discouraged from contributing to block creation and transaction processing, undermining the fundamental principle of equitable decentralization. In this research, we introduce a hash power-based consensus protocol that provides opportunities to low-stakes validators. We raise the decentralization factor by extending a ’hash power’ metric, which is calculated from the minted and native stakes of a participant. The proposed consensus algorithm enhances the selection mechanism of forgers and validators in the network, making the distribution of validation opportunities more equitable. It also improves the voting strategy in the presence of malicious actors, enhancing security.

## Tulika Choudhary - AI-Driven Multi-Modal Framework for Enhancing Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Prognosi
<p style="font-size:14px;">
The diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pose significant challenges due to its multifactorial nature, involving intricate interactions between neuroimaging, clinical, and genetic data. This project presents a robust multi-modal AI framework designed to integrate these diverse data modalities, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment planning. Utilizing advanced deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial neuroimaging data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential clinical and genetic data, the proposed system captures both spatial and temporal patterns critical to understanding AD progression (Lozupone et al., 2024; Majee et al.,2024)

## Harshith Sai Veeraiah - A Novel Approach to Smart Contract Security
<p style="font-size:14px;">
The purpose of this project is to significantly strengthen the security of Ethereum-based decentralized applications by making it easier to detect and prevent vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. Traditional methods often rely on static sets of rules or known patterns, which can quickly become outdated in a fast-moving threat environment. New types of attacks are constantly emerging, and adversaries are getting smarter, finding ways around common checks.To tackle this challenge, this project combines the power of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and advanced transformer-based AI models. ASTs break down the code into a structured, tree-like format, making it easier to understand the logical flow of the contract. Transformer models, known for their ability to capture complex relationships and context, then analyze these structures. By linking these two techniques, the approach can uncover subtle, previously unknown vulnerabilities that traditional scans might miss.

## Madan Ballupet Venkatesh - Intelligent Agricultural Suggestion System
<p style="font-size:14px;">
Agriculture AI, empowers farmers by providing accurate disease predictions and actionable insights. The system leverages Ensemble Learning techniques in machine learning (ML) to predict plant diseases effectively. To enhanceuser trust and transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is integrated to clarify predictions, making the system more reliable and user-friendly. Beyond disease detection, the application also identifies plant types based on leaf samples, adding versatility to its functionality. All data, including predictions and supporting information, are stored in a centralized database. This database serves as a resource for researchers and developers to evaluate the application's accuracy, identify trends, and notify farmers of new or unidentified diseases. Additionally, the application facilitates communication between farmers, researchers, and developers, allowing users to raise queries andprovide feedback. This comprehensive tool bridges the gap between advanced AI technology and agricultural needs, supporting global efforts to enhance productivity and sustainability in farming.
