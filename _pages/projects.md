## Ongoing Projects

### Smart Contracts with Deep Learning Algorithm Intelligence to Secure Preidiction Applications
  We would like to develop smart contracts to perform feature extraction, training, and classification for CNN and RNN algorithms. CNN algorithms will have a high degree of computations for feature extraction that will 
  involve two smart contracts: one for convolution and ReLU and the other for pooling. Also, as a final step, the neural network training and classification can use a separate smart contract for the DApp to be more modular 
  and agile. RNN would involve a similar way of training weights but with a sequential model, as discussed earlier. The tokenization of the language model is to be preprocessed and then fed into the neural network with the 
  required functions. The neural network will consist of inputs prior input, output activation function outputs, and so on for predicting series data. The parameters of weights for each layer needs to be updated with 
  forward and backward propagation for optimization purpose. The smart contracts for RNN would involve all the functions involved in the model development for training and prediction.
  
### Decision Trees to Help Smart Contracts to Predict for Machine Learnign Algorithms
  Blockchain helps AI to build trustworhty and immutable predictions system. To further study the nature of smart contract problems and their limitations to predict using machine learning algorithm, we need to investigate 
  Decision Tree algorithm and evaluate the mathematical model for smart contracts to help the prediction algorithms. Building Decision Trees require the computation of entropy and information gain to identify the best 
  feature with best split to create the decision tree. We will derive the necessary equations to compute  the complex mathematical equations and implement them inside the smart contract. Moreover, the blockchain is 
  expensive for layer one computations. The layer two scalability options are good in terms of speed but not secure enough. We will use layer one scalability options for our algorithm and record the performance evaluation. 

### BLOCKAI Trustmeter: A Guide to Quantify The Trust of AI in Decentralized Ledger
  The quest to help AI Algorithms through blockchain platform demands proofs that blockchain helps build trust in securing AI algorithms. Detering model poisoning attack is discussed in many academic articles. However, the 
  methods that secure the models from poisoning are mostly theoretical that does not guarantee trust in the cognitive formulae. The blockchain platforms are creating footprints everywhere making data in applications tamper- 
  proof. Some of the applications have clear benefits for using blockchain. Financial transactions are a major user of blockchain technology that protects against centralized threats. Complex applications from Artificial 
  Intelligence are driving towards blockchain-based prediction system, but many are unware about how could blockchain help AI? This research focuses on the qunatitative analysis of security enhancement that blockchain 
  provides to AI algorithms. This will include the security abalysis of non-blockchain versus blockchain-based prediction system
